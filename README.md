# metro_sytsem_layout_using_dsa
This project focuses on optimizing the metro system 
layout for a bustling city by employing advanced data structures 
and algorithms (DSA) techniques. The primary objectives are to 
efficiently determine the shortest paths between key locations and 
subsequently identify optimal stations for the metro system, 
considering travel cost as the pivotal factor.
To achieve this, the project leverages graph theory and various 
DSA algorithms, including Prim's algorithm, to compute the most 
time-efficient routes between prominent city locations. This process 
involves converting the city's geography into a graph 
representation, with locations as nodes and transportation 
connections as edges.
Following the computation of shortest paths, a careful analysis is 
conducted to select key locations as metro stations. The project 
optimizes metro layout using graph theory, Prim's algorithm, and 
Max Flow Min Cut. It efficiently finds shortest paths between 
locations and selects optimal metro stations considering travel cost 
and passenger flow. The addition of Max Flow Min Cut enhances 
capacity planning and congestion analysis, ensuring an efficient 
metro system for the bustling city. This project involves the usage of 
various primary linear and advanced data structures to meet its 
objectives
